We are the R user group for Portland, Oregon. Our goal is to support and share R experience and knowledge among its users in the Portland community.

We have regularly scheduled monthly meetups ([aggregate](aggregate.html)) and also host [other events](meetups.html).

# Upcoming Events

- December 8 - aggregate - featuring Advanced RMarkdown tips by Brendan Cullen

# Want to give a talk?

We always want people to share their R knowledge. You can give a short lightning style talk as part of aggregate, or a longer form talk about an R Topic as a meetup session. 

Get in touch via email at pdxrlang@gmail.com, or if youâ€™re a Meetup.com member you can message us there.
