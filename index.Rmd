We are the R user group for Portland, Oregon. Our goal is to support and share R experience and knowledge among its users in the Portland community. 

We have regularly scheduled monthly meetups ([aggregate](aggregate.html)) and also host [other events](meetups.html).

# Upcoming Events

- Hey folks, due to the weather situation and so many people without power/internet/heat in the area we are rescheduling tonight's event for next week. We look forward to seeing everyone next week, stay safe.

- [February 23rd - aggregate](https://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/events/276194867/) - Jim Tyhurst will do a short demonstration of `git` commands.

# Want to give a talk?

We always want people to share their R knowledge. You can give a short lightning style talk as part of aggregate, or a longer form talk about an R Topic as a meetup session. 

Get in touch via direct message on Twitter  [\@pdxrlang](https://twitter.com/pdxrlang), or if youâ€™re a Meetup.com member you can [message us there](https://secure.meetup.com/messages/).
